      "Yo! I’m drashekhar Sharma, a front-end developer on my way to becoming a full-stack wizard 🧙‍♂️. Currently, I vibe with React and Tailwind CSS, building clean, smooth, and user-friendly web apps. But hey, the backend is on my hit list too – soon I’ll be handling both sides ! I’m here to build, break (a little), and grow big. Let’s make something awesome – and maybe have some laughs on the way! 🎯🔥",

A lot of my projects are open-source, so feel free to dive in, explore the code, and if you’ve got spicy ideas or upgrades – hit me up! I genuinely love learning, growing, and teaming up with people who are just as excited about tech as I am.",
